            We are a legendary group that tackled the most daring and insane quests in history. You may have heard of us. If not, roll a d20, and keep reading. We could regale you with countless stories about the rise and falls of empires and dominions, the greatest songs of tragic love or heroic deeds. But nevermind all that. Let’s skip to the only tale of any real significance. Yours and ours.
            <br>
            <br>
            Shall we regale you though? *grins broadly*
            Depending on which world you’ll visit, assuming there’s any witnesses ... *coughs awkwardly* ... erhm...survivors left, you’ll hear a few things about us. You’ll know we’ve defied the Aeon Priesthood with a numenera infused strange synthsteel instrument that erased all ambition of those who heard it. It also made you love puppies for some reason.
            <br>
            <br>
            We have been friendly outlaws, quasi-intelligent warriors, dashing rogues and cunning lords. We’ve traded a fake ring to good ol’ king Gladivir in exchange for his daughter’s hand. Our lecherous half-orcish companion was never happier. The civil war that ensued was totally unrelated. We have sundered the thrones of gods, tricked demons and treaded where no mortals dare to tread. We’ve loved men and women of all races and made up lies and songs that made the minstrels quit the business.
            But most of all, we had fun. And we made memories.
            <br>

            We’re adventurers, dreamers, players, fantasy and story lovers. We’re a crazy bunch, and we found companionship in our insanity. We made this place where crazy stories come to life with everybody pitches in his own bit, for us and for you. This small humble site where you can find people to play pen and paper games and give you ideas along the way.
            Not just for D&D but for all story driven games, that might just be what you seek, when you don’t know it’s seeking you. Your story awaits, and it would be our honor to be a small part of it.
